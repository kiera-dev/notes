Helpful Linux Cmds 

Basic:

pwd - print directory 
cd - change directory 
cat - prints file contents 
cp - copy
mv - move
mkdir - create dir
touch - create empty
rm - remove 
ls - list 
man - open manual 
chmod - change mode (change file permissions to be read write, for example)
shutdown 
sudo 
su
unzip - extract 
apt / yum / pacman
echo 
kill 
history 
tail - output last 10 lines of a file 
head - output first 10 lines of a file 
grep - searches for a line that matches a regex 
	grep "linux" long.txt
wget - web get. Ex: download a python file from GitHub 


Less Basic / less used: 

alias  - define temp aliases. You can use a word instead of typing out a large ass command every time. 
	Here you change ls to have color without having to 	type out the flag: 
		alias ls="ls --color=auto"
	unalias - removes the alias 

htop - view/manage resources 
ps - look at processes 
passwd - change password 
which - output path for programs 
shred - super delete 
whoami - if you forget what user you are signed into 
wc - wordcount 
uname -a - output OS info 
neofetch - even better OS info 
Find - search for files in a dir 
	find ./ -name "long.txt" # ./long.txt 


Shortcuts: 

^name1^name2 - Re-runs the previous command and replaces. Ex: 
	“sudo apt-get update” and then “^date^grade” 		magically becomes “sudo apt-get upgrade”
