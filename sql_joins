Joins in SQL are used to combine data from two or more database tables based on related columns. JOIN tldr:

INNER JOIN:
Returns only the rows where there is a match in both tables based on the specified condition.
Discards rows with no matching counterpart in the other table.

LEFT JOIN (or LEFT OUTER JOIN):
Returns all the rows from the left table and the matching rows from the right table.
If there is no match in the right table, the result will contain NULL values for the right table's columns.

RIGHT JOIN (or RIGHT OUTER JOIN):
Returns all the rows from the right table and the matching rows from the left table.
If there is no match in the left table, the result will contain NULL values for the left table's columns.

FULL JOIN (or FULL OUTER JOIN):
Returns all the rows when there is a match in either the left or right table.
If there is no match in either table, the result will contain NULL values for the respective table's columns.

CROSS JOIN (or Cartesian Join):
Returns the Cartesian product of rows from both tables (all possible combinations).
Doesn't require any condition to be specified, resulting in a large number of output rows.
It's important to note that the choice of join depends on the specific data retrieval needs 
and how the tables are related. INNER JOIN is the most commonly used type, but the others can be valuable when you need to retrieve different sets of data.
